# Copy

### Description...
Shell script that copies everything inside the current folder into a folder called myCopy.

### How to work it...
Download the file and navigate to it through your terminal.

```
cd /.../.../copier.sh
./copier.sh
```

As soon as you run `./copier.sh` the terminal will give a sort of overview telling you what it did as such:
```
----- Files ------
copier.sh
myCopy
cp: myCopy is a directory (not copied).
testfile1.txt
testfile2.txt
testfile3.txt
```
Please don't pay attention to the `cp: myCopy is a directory (not copied).` because it doesn't affect the script at all. 
For those that want to know what it is, it is just telling you that the myCopy directory was not copied. Fork?

### Why I wrote it?
I had just learned how to shell script and I thought it was the best way to test my skills. 
There will be a lot more to see later on!

### Motivation from me...
